# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project required me to create a scheduler that could save tasks to local storage, identify the current hour and also correctly identify past and future hours

I started by creating an array to cycle through the times and then created an if statement to assign different classes to those hours depending on whether they were current, past or future
I then appended a label, textarea and button to each row
from there I was able to create a function for the save button that saved the current input to local storage so that when you reload the page, it will stay there until it is cleared out

This application is now fully functioning and will store all of your to do tasks throughout the day as well as color code what you should be working on!
